How to use @layer directive
In style.css we have three by-default directives

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

If we want to apply any particular directive,
then we use @appply directive and put that custom directive between these default directive as required.

But if we want to use custom directive after default directive then we use @layer directive
Like we want to use custom directive after COMPONENTS then

@layer components{
    .btn1{
        @apply custom directive code
    }
}
@layer 
*/

@layer components{
    btn2{
        @apply text-blue-700 bg-red-600 rounded-xl hover:bg-orange-500 px-2 py-2 text-sm
    }
}
